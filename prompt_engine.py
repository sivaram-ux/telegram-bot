    "real_world_applications": "Rewrite the prompt to guide the LLM toward output that maps theoretical ideas to real-world use cases, industries, or everyday scenarios.",
    "personal_growth": "Rewrite the prompt so the LLM provides actionable advice, reflection prompts, and behavioral frameworks for improving mindset, habits, or emotional resilience.",
    "marketing_landing_page": "Rewrite the prompt to produce marketing copy suitable for a product or service landing page. Include headline, problem/solution framing, benefits, CTA, and testimonials if applicable.",

    Act as a world-class prompt engineering expert.

    Your task is to transform a raw, basic user query into a fully optimized, detailed, and highly effective prompt designed for use with advanced LLMs like Gemini 1.5 Pro or Claude 3 Opus.

    🎯 Your optimized prompt must retain the original intent but dramatically expand its scope, specificity, and structure.

    🧠 Apply the following techniques where appropriate:

    1. **Role & Persona** — Assign an expert identity to the AI (e.g., “You are a veteran data scientist with 15 years of industry experience.”)
    2. **Context** — Add background info or assumptions to frame the task meaningfully.
    3. **Audience** — Define who the output is intended for (e.g., beginner, developer, executive).
    4. **Structure & Format** — Specify how the answer should be organized (e.g., "Use a three-part breakdown with bullets and a markdown table").
    5. **Goals & Intent** — State what the user wants to achieve (e.g., “The goal is to create a step-by-step learning plan...”).
    6. **Key Elements** — Include concepts, examples, analogies, pitfalls, comparisons, and optional depth levels.
    7. **Constraints** — Add exclusions if appropriate (e.g., “Do not include political commentary”).

    🎯 MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION: **{modes[mode]}**

    ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Do NOT output any commentary, apologies, or explanations. Output ONLY the **final refined prompt** as plain text.

Compare the following two prompts and return a structured analysis in **valid JSON format** using the schema below.

📌 Original Prompt:
"{original_prompt}"

🎯Final Goal of optimized prompt:
"{modes[mode]}"

✨ Optimized Prompt:
"{optimized_prompt}"

Return exactly this JSON object structure:

  }},
  "llm_understanding_improvements": ["..."],

🧠 Section Guidance:
👍 Original Prompt Strengths  
• (State what the user’s original prompt did well.)  
• (Be generous but honest.)

👎 Original Prompt Weaknesses  
• (Point out key missing elements or flaws in the original.)  
• (Explain the impact of those weaknesses.)

🧠 What LLMs Understand Better Now  
• (Explain how the refined prompt improves LLM comprehension.)  
• (Focus on structure, role, clarity, and specificity.)

💡 Tips for Future Prompts  
• (Give practical suggestions to improve prompt writing skills.)  
• (Focus on what to try next time — structure, constraints, or specificity.)

⚠️ Important Instructions:
- Do NOT output anything other than the JSON object.
- Make sure the response is valid JSON and not a markdown code block.
